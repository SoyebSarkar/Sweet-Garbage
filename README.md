# Problem
The problem of waste in India is huge. With the increasing population, the amount of waste generated every day is bound to increase. Increasing the number of landfills and throwing waste there is not a solution as landfills can take in a limited amount of waste.
# Example of Waste Management
Germany managed to reach this point by changing their attitude to see solid waste not as garbage but as a business opportunity. Currently, Germany annually saves â‚¬3.7 billion from recycling and energy generated from waste. Their waste processing units help them save three percent cost of energy imports along with 20 percent cost of metals.

# What I Want To Build
I want to build a platform where we can control waste management problem in India. On this platform, people can volunteer and by volunteering in this initiative he/she earns Garbage coin, Later he/she can redeem these coins as cash, product, coupon, etc.
